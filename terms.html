      Effective date: 20 September 2025 &nbsp;•&nbsp; Last updated: 20 September 2025
    </p>

    <h2 id="s1-heading">1) Who we are and how to contact us</h2>
    <div id="s1-text">
      <p>Brainstorm Buddy (the “Service”) is provided by Ibrahim Ahmed (“we”, “us”, “our”).</p>
      <p>Address: 167–169 Great Portland Street, 5th Floor, London, W1W 5PF, UK</p>
      <p>Email: <a href="mailto:brainstormbuddyy@gmail.com">brainstormbuddyy@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>If you have a privacy question or complaint, you can also contact the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) at <a href="https://ico.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ico.org.uk</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s2-heading">2) What these Terms do</h2>
    <div id="s2-text">
      <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Service (including our extension, website, and related features). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy (linked in the footer of our site/app). If you use the Service on behalf of a business, you confirm you’re authorised to bind that business.</p>
    </div>

  
    <h2 id="s3-heading">3) Your account</h2>
    <div id="s3-text">
      <p>Some features require an account. Keep your credentials safe; you’re responsible for activity on your account. Tell us promptly if you suspect unauthorised use.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s4-heading">4) AI-generated content (important)</h2>
    <div id="s4-text">
      <p>Brainstorm Buddy uses AI (including services from OpenAI) to generate ideas and draft content. AI outputs can be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate and are not professional advice. By using AI features, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for how you use and interpret outputs (including fact-checking and compliance with law).</li>
        <li>We provide the Service “as is” for creativity and productivity purposes and do not guarantee accuracy or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s5-heading">5) Acceptable use</h2>
    <div id="s5-text">
      <p>You must not use the Service to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Break the law or infringe others’ rights (including copyright and trademarks).</li>
        <li>Produce or share illegal, deceptive, harmful, or privacy-invasive content; malware; or content that facilitates harm.</li>
        <li>Misrepresent AI outputs as factual without checks where accuracy matters.</li>
        <li>Attempt to bypass technical limits, probe our systems, or create multiple accounts to evade limits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may remove content, throttle usage, or suspend/terminate accounts for breaches or risks to safety, privacy, or system stability.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s6-heading">6) Plans, usage limits, and fairness</h2>
    <div id="s6-text">
      <p><strong>Plan name:</strong> Elite &nbsp;•&nbsp; <strong>Monthly allowance:</strong> up to 700 AI idea generations per month per account.</p>
      <p>We may temporarily throttle or suspend access if you materially exceed allowances or misuse the Service. Creating multiple accounts to bypass limits is prohibited. We may publish updated operational thresholds from time to time to protect system health.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s7-heading">7) Prices, auto-renewal, cancellations, and refunds</h2>
    <div id="s7-text">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto-renewal.</strong> Subscriptions (monthly or annual) renew automatically until you cancel on the website in your account settings or by contacting us.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling-off for UK consumers.</strong> If you purchase online as a consumer, you have 14 days from purchase to cancel for any reason. If you ask us to start the service within the 14-day period, you acknowledge that once the service is fully performed you lose the right to cancel, and we may deduct a proportionate amount for services already provided. To cancel within the cooling-off period, use the in-app flow or email <a href="mailto:brainstormbuddyy@gmail.com">brainstormbuddyy@gmail.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> <em>Monthly subscriptions:</em> You can cancel anytime to stop future renewals. Fees already paid are generally non-refundable, except where the 14-day cooling-off right applies (subject to any proportionate deduction if you asked us to start immediately). <em>Annual subscriptions:</em> You may cancel within 14 days of purchase under the cooling-off rules (subject to proportionate deduction if you asked us to start immediately). After 14 days, annual fees are non-refundable.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> Refunds are typically processed within 5 to 10 business days to the original payment method.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund abuse:</strong> To prevent misuse, we may limit future purchases or decline further refund requests if more than two refunds have been approved for the same account or payment method.</li>
        <li>We will notify you before any price change takes effect on your next renewal.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s8-heading">8) Payments and third-party services</h2>
    <div id="s8-text">
      <p>Payments are processed by Stripe. We also use services from Google (including Gmail) for communications and operations. Their terms and privacy policies apply to their services. See our Privacy Policy for details of data sharing and safeguards.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s9-heading">9) Privacy and data protection</h2>
    <div id="s9-text">
      <p>We are the data controller for personal data processed via the Service. We process data to provide, secure, and improve the Service and to communicate with you. Key points (see our Privacy Policy for full details):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lawful bases may include contract, legitimate interests, and consent (where applicable).</li>
        <li>We use service providers (including OpenAI, Stripe, and Google) under contract.</li>
        <li>Some processing may occur outside the UK with appropriate safeguards.</li>
        <li>Your rights include access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection, and the right to complain to the ICO.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s10-heading">10) Intellectual property</h2>
    <div id="s10-text">
      <p>The Service, including software, content, and branding, is our property or our licensors’. Brainstorm Buddy is our trademark.</p>
      <p><strong>Your inputs &amp; AI outputs.</strong> You retain rights in your input content. To operate the Service, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to host, process, and display your inputs and to generate outputs at your direction. Subject to third-party rights and these Terms, you may use the outputs for your purposes. You must ensure you have all necessary rights in your inputs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s11-heading">11) Service changes and availability</h2>
    <div id="s11-text">
      <p>We may update or change features to improve performance or address security/legal requirements. If we make material changes that negatively impact you, we’ll give at least 30 days’ notice (by email or in-app) where reasonable, and you may cancel before the change takes effect. We aim for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service. Planned maintenance will be announced where feasible.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s12-heading">12) Suspension and termination</h2>
    <div id="s12-text">
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you materially or repeatedly breach these Terms or law; if your usage poses a security or stability risk; or if required by law or a provider. We’ll try to give reasonable notice where appropriate. On termination, your right to use the Service ends, but terms that should reasonably survive (e.g., IP, liability limits, refunds already processed) will continue. See our Privacy Policy for retention and deletion.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s13-heading">13) Disclaimers</h2>
    <div id="s13-text">
      <p>Except as expressly stated in these Terms, the Service (including AI features) is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not promise that outputs will be accurate, complete, or suitable for any particular purpose. You should independently verify important information.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s14-heading">14) Liability (UK wording)</h2>
    <div id="s14-text">
      <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</p>
      <p><em>If you are a consumer:</em> We are not responsible for loss or damage that is not foreseeable, that you could have avoided by following our reasonable instructions, or that results from your misuse of the Service.</p>
      <p><em>If you use the Service for business purposes:</em> We exclude all implied conditions, warranties, or representations to the maximum extent permitted by law; and our total aggregate liability in any 12-month period shall not exceed the higher of £100 or the fees you paid for the Service in that period.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s15-heading">15) Indemnity (business users)</h2>
    <div id="s15-text">
      <p>If you use the Service for or on behalf of a business, you agree to indemnify us against third-party claims arising from your unlawful use of the Service or your breach of these Terms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s16-heading">16) Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <div id="s16-text">
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. For material changes, we will give at least 30 days’ notice before they take effect. If you do not agree, you may cancel before the effective date; continuing to use the Service after that date means you accept the changes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s17-heading">17) Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
    <div id="s17-text">
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Courts in England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, except that consumers in Scotland or Northern Ireland may bring claims in their local courts.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="s18-heading">18) Miscellaneous</h2>
    <div id="s18-text">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No waiver:</strong> If we delay enforcing these Terms, we can still enforce them later.</li>
        <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any part is unlawful or unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer your rights without our consent; we may assign in connection with a reorganisation or sale.</li>
        <li><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms and our Privacy Policy are the entire agreement between you and us for the Service.</li>
